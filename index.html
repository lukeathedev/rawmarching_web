      <p>
        This is a live demo of a tiny <i>bare-metal</i> program that is capable
        of rendering a raymarching-based scene. The 'screen' you see below is an
        actual computer! (well, it <i>emulates</i> one at least). Since the
        emulator is web-based, execution is very slow. Expect to wait a couple
        of minutes to get the full image. You can read
        <a href="#writeup">the rest of the page</a> and then come back here to
        check on the progress. If you're extra impatient, there are instructions
        on compiling everything yourself and running the code locally (which
        often results in faster execution) at the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lukeathedev/rawmarching/"
          >github repo</a

      <h3>1. &nbsp; Some Background Information</h3>
      <p>
        What makes this raymarching example differ from others is the fact that
        it runs as a standalone, self-contained system (and, (un)fortunately,
        runs on the CPU). Know <i>Windows 10</i>? <i>MacOS</i>?
        <i>GNU/Linux</i>? We're not using any of that here. Every function
        that's ever called was explicitly defined at some point - no such thing
        as a standard library. Even the square root function had to be
        re-implemented (I used a binary search algorithm). In order to better
        understand what's needed to go from nothingness to pixels on a screen,
        first we must look at how a typical desktop computer processor is setup.
      </p>

      <div class="cluster">

        <div class="cluster-content">
          <p>
            <b>2.1 &nbsp;</b>
            The computer boots up in what is known as
            <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Real_Mode"
              >real mode</a
            >, an execution state where the processor can't even address 1MB of
            memory and can only use 16-bit registers (variable-holders of
            sorts). In order to use the CPU to its full potential, most modern
            systems enter protected mode, which allows for the use of 32 or even
            64-bit registers, as well as at least 4GB of RAM. In order for that
            to happen, though, the programmer must time-travel through well over
            30 years of backwards compatibility, delving into the bizarre
            idiosyncrasies of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86 architecture</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2.2 &nbsp;</b>
            Awkwardly enumerated as '2', the first step is to create a
            bootloader that, through the use of
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS_interrupt_call#Purpose_of_BIOS_calls"
              >BIOS interrupts</a
            >, sets up the environment and loads up the actual raymarching
            program (named <i>kernel.c</i> - alluding to the fact that this is a
            process more common to operating systems than standalone
            executables). Since computers usually only load the first 512 bytes
            of a bootable disk, it is desirable to split the bootloader into two
            stages, to make sure everything fits. <i>stage1.s</i> in the
            <i>boot/</i> source directory does just that, with the help of
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_13H"
              >INT 13H</a
            >
            - a rather scary-sounding BIOS subroutine (low-level function) that
            deals with disks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2.3 &nbsp;</b>
            <i>stage2.s</i> is then responsible for some rather weird things.
            For compatibility reasons, the 21st memory address bit is disabled
            by default, meaning that you can only access 1MB of memory, instead
            of 16MB. The first step, therefore, is to enable the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.osdev.org/A20_Line"
              >A20 Line</a
            >. If you're wondering how one can access so much memory with just
            16 bits, the aforementioned link explains that the architecture uses
            a memory segmentation system. Now that the A20 Line is up and
            running, we can use INT 13H again to load the kernel (main, core
            program) to a sensible memory location.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2.4 &nbsp;</b>
            Lastly, the
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Descriptor_Table"
              >Global Descriptor Table (GDT)</a
            >
            is loaded by the CPU, specifying how the memory should be layout in
            32-bit mode. Following that, all that remains is to signal that
            we're entering protected mode by setting the <i>PE</i> bit of the
            <a
              target="_blank"

              >Control Register 0</a
            >
            and to execute a far (absolute) jump to the code segment defined by
            the GDT, where the kernel was previously loaded. Phew!

            <b>3.1 &nbsp;</b>
            All of the hassle of the previous section did come with some fairly
            significant benefits, however. Not only is the kernel code now able
            to fully utilise the processor, but we're also able to write code in
            an actual programming language, namely
            <a
              target="_blank"

              >C</a
            >. I didn't mention it, but if you had the curiosity to peek at the
            source code, you probably noticed that all the code so far was
            written in
            <a

              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language"
              >assembly language</a

            (hinted at by the <i>.s</i> file extensions).

          <p>
            <b>3.2 &nbsp;</b>
            Compiling C code is a bit trickier than it seems, though. Most
            compilers are used to the cozyness of a fully-fledged operating
            system, where there is access to standard libraries and many other
            abstractions. I won't go into too many details, but it is safe to
            bet that you'll get very nasty bugs if you don't remind yourself
            that you're in a barebones environment. For that reason, a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler"
              >cross compiler</a
            >
            is usually built. Assuming everything is working as it should, now
            we're tasked with interfacing with the
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array"
              >VGA adapter</a

            and calculating some pixel values.

        </div>

        <h3>4. &nbsp; Graphics Programming</h3>

        <p>
          <b>4.1 &nbsp;</b>
          Talking to the VGA-compatible card is thankfully a bit more
          straightforward - if you're not planning on switching video modes,
          that is. Firstly a color palette is set by writing to specific
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_input%E2%80%93output"
            >ports</a
          >
          on the computer (I chose grayscale for simplicity). I didn't mention
          it, but we'll be using 320x200 256 color video - a far cry from full
          HD or even 4K, but more than good enough for a simple demonstration.
          Then, we can begin setting pixels by writing to memory addresses that
          the adapter is using. In this video mode, the pixel buffer starts at
          location
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/specs/freevga/vga/vgamem.htm"
            >0xA0000</a
          >, so all that's left to be done is to calculate the pixel values with
          some algorithm and write them there. The algorithm, in case it wasn't
          totally apparent, is raymarching.

              Fully explaining raymarching would take a document of its own, so
              I'll just briefly mention what it does, given that the main goal
              of the project was to illustrate how to interface with the
              hardware at the low level. In sum, raymarching is about casting
              <a
                target="_blank"

              >
              from a point in 3D space and checking for intersections with
              predefined geometry. In raymarching, the geometry is not
              determined by discrete points, but rather by
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function"
                >signed distance functions</a
              >. This means that spheres are mathematically perfect and many
              operations can easily be performed on the objects. With proper
              distance functions, simple lighting can be calculated by
              determining the angle between the surface of the object and a
              punctiform light source.

                <b>4.3 &nbsp;</b>
                Now that rays are cast for each pixel in the direction of the
                scene and the lighting is then calculated, the intensity of the
                light value can be directly poked into the VGA memory location
                previously discussed. Let it run for a while and we get this:
